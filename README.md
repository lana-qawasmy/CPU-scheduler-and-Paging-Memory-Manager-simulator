# CPU-scheduler-and-Paging-Memory-Manager-simulator

Part1: Simulate a CPU scheduler: 

The idea of the project is to receive a list of processes (n processes) with different arrival times and different CPU bursts. Also each process will have a size in bytes 

The  program that will read these processes from a file called processes.txt that contains the list of process that should be scheduled. 



Part2 : Simulate a Paging Memory Manager:  

The idea of the project is to receive a list of processes ( n processes, from 1 to 10) with different sizes in bytes.

The program that will read these processes from a file called Processes.txt that contains the list of process that should be loaded into physical memory of size msize. A sample input is like the file in Part 1.
